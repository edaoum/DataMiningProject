# 📊 Data mining & customer segmentation projects

## 🚀 Project overview

This repository contains two practical Data Mining projects demonstrating clustering techniques on real-world datasets to uncover hidden insights:

- **Driver clustering**
- **Mall customer segmentation**

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/`: datasets used in the notebooks.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks explaining each step in detail.
- `Project_details.pdf`: additional context and instructions provided originally.

## 🗃️ Datasets

- **Driver_data.csv**: dataset containing driver behaviors for clustering analysis.
- **Mall_Customers.csv**: dataset containing customer information for market segmentation.

## 🧩 Projects description

### 🚗 Driver Clustering Analysis
- **Goal**: identify distinct groups of drivers based on driving behavior.
- **Techniques used**: KMeans clustering, data preprocessing, visualization.
- **Notebook**: [Driver_Clustering.ipynb](notebooks/Driver_Clustering.ipynb)

### 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation
- **Goal**: segment customers based on shopping behavior to improve marketing strategies.
- **Techniques used**: KMeans clustering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization.
- **Notebook**: [Mall_Customers_Segmentation.ipynb](notebooks/Mall_Customers_Segmentation.ipynb)
